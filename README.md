# SCA — Simple - Chat - App 

An opensource project for simple chatting

## Introduction

This project is a real-time chat application designed with simplicity, accessibility, and privacy in mind, making it especially suitable for beginner-level users. The app allows users to log in using their mobile numbers and view a list of currently available users. When two users are online simultaneously, they can communicate instantly through text messages. To maintain privacy and reduce server dependency, all chat data is stored locally on the users’ devices rather than on a central server.
The application is built using Flutter for the frontend, providing a responsive and cross-platform user interface, while Hive is used as the local storage solution for efficiently managing chat data on the device. The backend is developed with Python using FastAPI, which handles user connectivity and real-time communication logic.
For deployment and online accessibility, the backend is hosted on the free hosting tier of Render.com. This setup enables the system to run without infrastructure costs during development while still supporting live user interaction.
Overall, the project demonstrates how a lightweight, privacy-focused chat system can be built using modern development tools, combining real-time communication with local data storage and minimal server reliance.
